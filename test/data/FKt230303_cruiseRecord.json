Ghostly towers made of limestone sprang from the seafloor, spewing clear liquid, and very few creatures dwelled among the vents. When the scientists sampled the chemistry, they found it vastly different from black smoker vents on the nearby Mid-Atlantic Ridge volcanoes.\n\nThe scientists named the new, alkaline vent system, \"Lost City.\" They determined the reaction creating this new type of vent occurs on a geologic formation known as an oceanic core complex, where mantle rock is exposed to cold seawater. These carbonate vents form when the seawater and mantle rock react in a process known as serpentinization. ", "cruise_files": []}, "id": "6400d0e5c476e18a7cfc4ed1"}]
